Last Updated: 2025-12-09
================================================================================

1. GENERAL GUIDANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: This playbook applies to the "Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement" template.
Goal: Execute the standard form with minimal changes to speed up deal velocity.
Authority: Legal Operations / General Counsel.

2. CLAUSE-BY-CLAUSE GUIDANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLAUSE 1: PURPOSE
   * Standard Position: "To explore a potential business relationship."
   * Fallback: Can be specific (e.g., "To evaluate the purchase of software").
   * Walk-Away: Vague purposes like "general business dealings" or purposes that 
     imply an actual commercial transaction (e.g., "for the delivery of services").

CLAUSE 2: DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
   * Standard Position: Broad definition. Includes oral info if summarized in 
     writing within 30 days.
   * Fallback: Remove the requirement to summarize oral info (treat all oral 
     discussions as confidential if identified as such).
   * Walk-Away: Definitions that exclude "Trade Secrets" or "Financial Data."

CLAUSE 4: OBLIGATIONS OF RECEIVER (CRITICAL)
   * Standard Position: Strict confidence; use SOLELY for the Purpose.
   * Clause 4(d) (AI/ML): Explicit prohibition on using data to train AI/LLMs.
   * Fallback: None. Do not delete Clause 4(d) without Legal approval.
   * Red Flag: Counterparty requesting "internal analytics," "benchmarking," or 
     "product improvement" rights.

CLAUSE 6: TERM AND TERMINATION
   * Standard Position: 3-year term. 3-year survival. Trade secrets perpetual.
   * Fallback: 
       - Term: 1 to 5 years is acceptable.
       - Survival: Can match the term.
   * Mandatory: Trade secrets must always be protected indefinitely/perpetually.

CLAUSE 8: REMEDIES
   * Standard Position: Acknowledgement of injunctive relief.
   * Fallback: Silence (removing the clause) is acceptable, as equitable relief 
     is usually available under common law regardless of the contract.

CLAUSE 9: GOVERNING LAW
   * Standard Position: [Your Company's Home State].
   * Fallback: Delaware or New York.
   * Walk-Away: International jurisdictions (unless approved by Legal) or states 
     with unfavorable trade secret laws.

3. ESCALATION TRIGGERS (REQUIRES LEGAL APPROVAL)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not sign if the counterparty requests changes to the following:

   [ ] AI TRAINING: Any request to delete Clause 4(d) or add language allowing 
       data usage for model training.
   [ ] INDEMNIFICATION: The template has no indemnity; do not add it.
   [ ] NON-SOLICIT: Do not agree to bans on hiring employees.
   [ ] EXCLUSIVITY: The NDA must not bind us to a vendor.
   [ ] IP ASSIGNMENT: No IP rights should transfer via an NDA.

4. NEGOTIATION SHORTCUTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* If they use their paper: Review primarily for "Residuals" clauses (allows them 
  to use retained memories of our data) and "Purpose" scope.
* If they strike "Injunctive Relief": Accept it to close the deal (low risk).
* If they want a 1-year term: Accept it for simple vendor evaluations; reject 
  for M&A or strategic partnerships.
