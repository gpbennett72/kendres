================================================================================

1. OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: Use this guide to negotiate the Company Mutual NDA.
Instruction: Attempt to maintain the "Standard Position" first. If pushed, you 
may offer the "Approved Fallback" language without Legal approval.

2. CLAUSE LIBRARY AND FALLBACKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. PURPOSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STANDARD POSITION: Broad exploration.
"The parties wish to explore a potential business relationship (the 'Purpose')."

APPROVED FALLBACK (Specific Transaction):
If the deal is defined (e.g., a specific RFP or service):
"The parties wish to evaluate a potential agreement regarding [Insert Specific 
Project Name or Service Description] (the 'Purpose')."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION (ORAL DISCLOSURE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STANDARD POSITION: Oral info protected ONLY if summarized in writing.
"...Information disclosed orally shall be considered Confidential Information if 
identified as such at the time of disclosure or summarized in writing within 
thirty (30) days of disclosure."

APPROVED FALLBACK (No Summary Required):
Counterparties often reject the admin burden of summarizing meetings.
"Information disclosed orally shall be considered Confidential Information if 
it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or if a reasonable 
person would understand it to be confidential given the nature of the information."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. EXCLUSIONS (TIME LIMITS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STANDARD POSITION: No time limit on the exclusions exceptions.

APPROVED FALLBACK (Prior Knowledge):
If they ask to clarify "Prior Knowledge" requires written proof:
"(b) was known to the Receiver prior to disclosure by the Discloser as 
evidenced by the Receiver's written records;"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D. OBLIGATIONS (DATA USE & AI)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STANDARD POSITION: Strict prohibition on AI training.
"(d) Not use Confidential Information to train, fine-tune, or improve any 
artificial intelligence or machine learning models;"

APPROVED FALLBACK (Aggregated Data - LOW RISK VENDORS ONLY):
Only acceptable if we are the Vendor and need to improve our own tools. NEVER 
ACCEPT if we are the Customer/Discloser.
"Notwithstanding the foregoing, Receiver may use extraneous, anonymized, and 
aggregated data derived from Confidential Information for the sole purpose of 
improving its products and services, provided such data cannot be reverse 
engineered to identify Discloser."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E. TERM (DURATION OF AGREEMENT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STANDARD POSITION: 3 Years.
"This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period 
of three (3) years."

APPROVED FALLBACK (Short Term):
"This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period 
of one (1) year."

APPROVED FALLBACK (Long Term):
"This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period 
of five (5) years."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F. SURVIVAL (DURATION OF PROTECTION)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STANDARD POSITION: 3 Years after termination.
"The confidentiality obligations herein shall survive the termination of this 
Agreement for a period of three (3) years..."

APPROVED FALLBACK (Match the Term):
If the Term is 5 years, Survival can be 5 years.

APPROVED FALLBACK (Perpetual - ONLY for our highly sensitive IP):
"The confidentiality obligations herein shall survive the termination of this 
Agreement indefinitely."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G. GOVERNING LAW & VENUE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STANDARD POSITION: California

APPROVED FALLBACK 1 (Delaware):
"This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware..."

APPROVED FALLBACK 2 (New York):
"This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York..."

APPROVED FALLBACK 3 (Silent/Neutral):
Remove the Governing Law clause entirely. This defaults to common law rules of 
conflicts (usually where the defendant is located).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H. RESIDUALS (MEMORY RIGHTS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STANDARD POSITION: Silent (No Residuals Clause).
We do not want to grant them rights to use "remembered" info.

APPROVED FALLBACK (Unaided Memory Only):
If a large tech vendor insists on this:
"Nothing herein shall preclude Receiver from using the residuals resulting from 
access to Confidential Information. 'Residuals' means information in 
non-tangible form which may be retained by persons who have had access to the 
Confidential Information, including ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques 
contained therein, provided such use is without reference to the written 
Confidential Information."

3. ESCALATION TRIGGERS (NO FALLBACKS AVAILABLE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Escalate to Legal if the counterparty insists on:

1.  No "Trade Secret" Exception: They must agree trade secrets are protected 
    forever.
2.  Uncapped Liability: If they ask for a Liability Cap (e.g., "Liability 
    limited to $100k"), escalate. NDAs should remain uncapped.
3.  Non-Solicit: If they want to ban hiring our employees.
4.  Publicity: If they want the right to issue a press release about this NDA.
